# dewclaw: semi-declarative OpenWrt configuration 

[OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) is an embedded Linux distribution optimized for small routers and access points with minimal amounts of storage to work with.

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is a general-purpose Linux distribution built from the ground up with declarative configuration in mind, usually using a bunch of storage to do its thing.

`dewclaw` is what happens if you try to mush the two together even though you know very well that you shouldn't.

Originally created by @pennae, you can find the annocement thread [here](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/dewclaw-semi-declarative-openwrt-configurations/33993).

This is a fork based on [the origial code](https://git.eno.space/dewclaw.git/).
